I am a web developer with 1 year of experience. I have successfully completed a full-stack course at HackYourFuture. Both remote and in-office roles are okay for me. I always want to take responsibility and deliver faster than expected. I am comfortable with React js, Next js and Node js.

Skills: JS / Next js / React js / Node js

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on HackYourFuture
